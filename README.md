# Welcome to Skin Stack üß¥ 

This project is an **API webserver** for a simple Skincare Routine Tracker application named Skin Stack, that helps users track their skincare products and daily skincare routines; helping users take the guesswork out of their beauty regime.

# Installation Instructions (MacOS)

### Create Python Virtual Environment

1. Open the Terminal to the folder where the project is located and run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment and open VS Code:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
code .
```

### Install Dependencies

1. Open a terminal window and install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create a new postgreSQL database

1. In a Terminal window start the PostgreSQL server with the following command:

```bash
service postgresql start
```

2. Open psql and create a database called 'skincare' with the following commands

```bash
psql postgres
```
```postgresql
create database skincare
```

### Create, Seed and Run the Database
1. Ensure you've exited out of `psql`. Then create the database with the project models use the following command:
```bash
flask db create
```

2. Seed the database with some starting data using the following command:
```bash
flask db seed
```

3. Finally run the database server in order to access the API endpoints, using the following command:
```bash
flask run
```

### Configuration
1. In Insomnia (or chosen tool) I've used port 5000. For example:
`http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`. You can use this port too.

2. This port should then be added as the default port (`FLASK_RUN_PORT`) into your `.flaskenv` file. If you are yet to create your `.flaskenv` file, an example configuratiton can be found at `.flaskenv.sample`:

```python
FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000
# ...
```

3. Ensure your JWT Key and the Database URI are also added to the `.flaskenv`. 

```python
JWT_KEY= # JWT signing key
DB_URI= # Database URI string
```

## 1. The problem üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <div id="1"/>

Millions of people globally have some kind of skincare routine; this can range from a simple daily moisturiser to a complex 10 step regime. But as a skincare routine grows, so too does the number of products you have, and the number of interactions between products that need to be considered. Some products need to be used at night time, others in the morning, some need to be washed of immediately, others kept on, some can't be used in conjunction with certain other products and others need to be used only twice a week. How do you keep track of it all?

## 2. Why should we solve it? ü§î <div id="2"/>

As someone that's recently embarked on a skincare journey I've felt this pain first hand. It's become increasingly challenging to keep track of which products I should be using, when I should be using them and what order I should be using them in. I've been on the hunt for solutions to help me track my routines but every application I tried is either too costly, has a lot of extra's around mood or food tracking and other aspects I'm not interested in or has poor UI making it frustrating to navigate. It's seemed impossible to find a simple, no-fluff skincare routine tracker that let's me add products in a click and tracks the what, how and when of my daily skincare routines.

And when speaking to people around me, it seems I'm not alone. Many have resorted to just using the notes app in their phone in lieu of a better solution. And as you can imagine it quickly becomes frustrating to manually add and change products or routines across all days of the week, not to mention the lack of product tracking or home screen reminders.

This is where Skin Stack comes in - an intuitive no-frills way to track and maintain your skincare routines without the effort.

## 3. Chosen database system (and it's drawbacks) üö¶ <div id="3"/>

PostgreSQL was chosen as it is a powerful relational database management system. For my project this is an important factor given the many-to-many relationship between Routines and Products (described in the ERD above). Additionally PostgreSQL offered more scalability and extensibility than other options (such as MySQL), as well as having robust data integrity functionality, making future project enhancements and expansions possible with ease.

However it's worth noting that these advantages do come with the trade off of performance. PostgreSQL being so highly exstensible comes at a cost, and as such it's not as lightweight as some of it's competitors. Taking thsi into consideration, having concurrency handled extremely well and certainty about the integrity of my data was worth the trade off.

## 6. ERD üìö <div id="6"/>

![ERD](docs/erd/skin_stack_erd.jpg)

### Key points:

- A user can have many routines
- A user can add many products
- Products can be added and not necessarily be in a routine
- Routines can technically be empty
- The workflow: empty routines are created and then products are later added to them
- Either new or existing products can be added to routines
  - (Will check if product exists first and if not, create a new one)
- Routines and products are scoped to a user, so they have full control over everything (Create, update, delete, get). There is no shared database across all users

## 7. Third party services used ü§ù <div id="7"/>

Throughout the course of this project, multiple third party services have been utillised to create this application. Some of the key ones include:

### SQL Alchemy

### Marshmallow

### Bcrypt

### JWT Manager

## 8. Project models (in terms of the relationships they have with each other) üß± <div id="8"/>

### User model

### Product model

### Routine model

### RoutineProduct model

## 9. Database relations implemented in this app üë´ <div id="9"/>

## 10. Task allocation & tracking (development plan) üíª <div id="10"/>
